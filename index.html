      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>My name is Matthew Kaye. I was born in 1997 and grew up in the town of Cortlandt Manor, New York. From a young age I was always very interested in Computers and Electronics. Although I knew that he had such an interest, it wouldnt be until a later age that I determined to strive to begin a career in Coding and Software Development.</p>
      <p>In my young adult life, I had 2 main hobbies that I had prioritized in my life. The first, was my commitment to the Boy Scouts of America. Scouting provided me so many tools to succeed, including my ability to see a project through from start to end, survival and life skills, as well as the ability to think flexibly and problem solve. My scounting experience spanned approximately 11 years before I earned the rank of Eagle Scout in 2014.
      <p>My second passion was for Martial Arts. In 2007 I began training in Tae-Kwon-Do. The instructors at my school were always so supportive and played a major part in my maturing from child to young Adult. After training for approximately 5 years, I attained the rank of Black Belt, and soon after became an assistant instructor for the school. 2 years later I became a second degree black belt as well. Unfortunately after a few more years the school was forced to shut down, however, this did not stop my curisity of what I was capable of. I continued training on my own, and eventually branched out to other styles of martial arts, including Boxing, Muay Thai, and Jiu Jitsu.</p>
      <p>In 2015, I graduated from Walter Panas High school, and decided to attend Binghamton University. In my time there, I had considered focusing my studies in a number of areas, from Chemistry to Actuarial Science, having a particular interest in phyical sciences. In taking many classes in different fields, a passion for statistics and data science was sparked. It was then I decided to pursue a major of Economics with a specialization in Financial Analysis. After graduating from Bingahtmon in the winter of 2019, I began working for RXR Realty in New York City as a Tenant Services Coordinator.</p>
      <p>After a number of years, I came to realize my desire to create my own websites and applications. Whenever there is a computer problem, I had always rushed to fix it myself if possible. After 2 years I came to my decision and enrolled in Columbia's Coding Bootcamp for Full Stack developers. Since the day I made this decision I have never looked back, and feel as though I truly have something to contribute to this community.</p>
